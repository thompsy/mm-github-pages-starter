Welcome to my home on the web. This is a space for me to put up my
research and writing. Have a look around and feel free to get in
touch.

Thanks.

## Who am I?

I'm a Christian living and working in my adoptive home, the great city
of Edinburgh, Scotland.

I've been gainfully employed doing a number of things over the years,
from flipping burgers, to building webservers, building systems to
troubleshoot mobile phone networks to building large scale distributed
systems for a large online company.

I'm actively involved in the Christian community in Edinburgh in
various different capacities. While I'm not occupied there I enjoy
reading in a range of different subjects from classics to theology to
technical and engineering books, not to mention playing the occasional
board game or two.
